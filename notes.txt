Ideas for fitness v2
    Challenges
        Give boosts as rewards for challenges?
        Just every once in a while
        Competition challenges (who can do the most x in the upcoming week)
        Coop challenges (can we combined hit x number of push ups in the upcoming week)
            Maybe set a limit on how many each person can add to the total per day
        Personal goal challenges
            Set them ahead of time
    Allow people to enter what they are doing so others can see
        Just like a listing that can be shown where each person has a little blurb
    Allow people to log a full or partial workout
        Have a type of streak thatâ€™s only full workouts and one that has a mix (or just partials) (will this encourage people not to do fulls?)
    Leaderboards of how many total workouts people have done
    Power ups like freeze streak to give rest days
    
    
Programming shit
    Add a t/f var in people for streak freeze active or not
    Add # var in people for how many streak freezes someone has (and a way to view it? Maybe a profile command to show ur profile)
