    Challenges
        Give boosts as rewards for challenges?
        Just every once in a while
        Competition challenges (who can do the most x in the upcoming week)
        Coop challenges (can we combined hit x number of push ups in the upcoming week)
            Maybe set a limit on how many each person can add to the total per day
        Personal goal challenges
            Set them ahead of time
    Allow people to enter what they are doing so others can see
        Just like a listing that can be shown where each person has a little blurb
    Leaderboards of how many total workouts people have done
    Power ups like freeze streak to give rest days
    
    
Programming shit
    Add # var in people for how many streak freezes someone has (and a way to view it? Maybe a profile command to show ur profile)
    Add # var in people for total (not streak) workouts and half workouts
    Add a t/f var for if description is public
    Add String var for descriptions of work outs
    Add command for listing persoanl profile (# workouts, Streak freezes available, description, etc etc)
    Add command for Leaderboards (not streaks, but totals)
    Add command for editing description and whether or not it's public /description-toggle is what it claims it is rn

    AAAAALLLL the challenges stuff
    Each challenge can have it's own Json file (can we make it so that we can create a json file with code?)
