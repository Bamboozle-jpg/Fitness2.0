Ideas for fitness v2
    Challenges
        Just every once in a while
        Competition challenges (who can do the most x in the upcoming week)
        Coop challenges (can we combined hit x number of push ups in the upcoming week)
        Maybe set a limit on how many each person can add to the total per day
    Allow people to enter what they are doing so others can see
        Just like a listing that can be shown where each person has a little blurb
    Allow people to log a full or partial workout
        Have a type of streak thatâ€™s only full workouts and one that has a mix (or just partials) (will this encourage people not to do fulls?)
    Leaderboards of how many total workouts people have done
